# Git Branch Merge Demo

This repository demonstrates the process of branching and merging in Git. It provides examples and instructions on how to effectively manage branches, resolve conflicts, and merge changes back into the main branch.

## Overview

Understanding how to work with branches is essential for collaborative development. This repository covers:

- Creating and managing branches
- Merging branches back into the main branch
- Handling merge conflicts
- Best practices for branch management

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zeeshank1/git-branch-merge-demo.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd git-branch-merge-demo
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch:**
   ```bash
