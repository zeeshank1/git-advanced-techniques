//error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/zeeshank1/genai-knowledge-hub'
//hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind ?

This error occurs because the remote branch has new commits that your local branch does not have. To resolve this, follow these steps:

**Solution 1**: Pull Before Push (Recommended)
```
sh

git pull --rebase origin main
git push origin main
```
This fetches the latest changes and applies your changes on top.
If you face conflicts, resolve them manually and then continue:

```
sh

git rebase --continue
git push origin main
```

**Solution 2**: Force Push (If You're Sure)
If you're certain your local changes should overwrite the remote branch, use:

```
sh

git push --force origin main
```
⚠ Warning: This will overwrite remote changes and should be used cautiously.

If you're using VS Code and facing this Git error, follow these steps to resolve it:

1. Pull the Latest Changes (Recommended)
Open VS Code and go to the Source Control panel (Ctrl + Shift + G).
Click the "Pull" button to get the latest changes from GitHub.
Resolve any merge conflicts if they appear.
Click "Commit" to save the resolved changes.
Now, click "Push" to send your changes.

Alternatively, use the VS Code Terminal:
```
sh

git pull --rebase origin main
git push origin main
```
2. Force Push (If Necessary)
If you're sure your local changes should overwrite the remote branch, use:

```
sh

git push --force origin main
```

⚠ Warning: This will overwrite any changes made on GitHub that you haven't pulled.

3. Reset and Sync (If Conflicts Persist)
If there are still issues, reset your local branch to match the remote:

```
sh

git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
git pull origin main
git push origin main
```
This will discard local changes that are not committed.
