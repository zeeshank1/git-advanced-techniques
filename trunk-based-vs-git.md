Trunk-Based vs Git Flow (Explained for a 10-Year-Old)
Imagine you are building a LEGO castle with your friends:

Trunk-Based Development: Everyone works together on the same part of the castle at the same time. If someone finds a problem, they fix it right there, so the castle grows quickly and stays strong.

Git Flow: Everyone works on different parts of the castle separately, like the towers or walls. They only bring their parts together once they are sure their pieces are perfect. It takes more time, but it makes sure no oneâ€™s part messes up the castle.

Trunk-Based Development vs Git Flow (Detailed Explanation)
Trunk-Based Development
What It Is:
Developers work directly on the main branch (often called "trunk") or create very short-lived branches for their work, merging back quickly.

Key Characteristics:

Changes are integrated frequently into the main branch.
Small, incremental updates.
Continuous integration and testing.
Advantages:

Fewer merge conflicts because changes are small and frequent.
Faster delivery of features and bug fixes.
Easier to maintain and deploy.
Challenges:

Requires strict discipline to avoid breaking the main branch.
Not suitable for large teams or complex projects without good tooling (e.g., feature flags).
Git Flow
What It Is:
Developers use multiple long-lived branches for features, releases, and hotfixes.

Key Characteristics:

Main branches:
master (for production-ready code).
develop (for integration and staging).
Feature branches: Separate branches for new features.
Release branches: Used for preparing releases.
Hotfix branches: Quickly fix bugs in production.
Advantages:

Clear structure for managing different stages of development.
Works well for larger teams and complex projects.
Easier to test and review before merging into develop or master.
Challenges:

Slower integration of changes due to branching and merging.
Risk of merge conflicts if branches are long-lived.
Requires more coordination between team members.
When to Use Which
Trunk-Based Development:
Best for small teams, fast-paced projects, or organizations practicing DevOps and Continuous Delivery.

Git Flow:
Best for large teams, projects with long release cycles, or when strict quality control is needed.

In summary, trunk-based is about speed and simplicity, while Git Flow is about structure and control.
